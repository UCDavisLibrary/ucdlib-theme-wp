# UC Davis "One" Wordpress Theme

This is a Wordpress theme that uses the styles from [UCD IET's Sitefarm One theme](https://bitbucket.org/ietwebdev/sitefarm-pattern-lab-one/src/redesign/docs/).

## Deployment
To use this theme, you can download it and place it in your Wordpress's `themes` folder. [Timber 2.0](https://upstatement.com/timber/) is a dependency, so you have to [install it via composer](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/installation/manage-timber-with-composer/) before activating the theme.

Alternatively, check out [this repository](https://github.com/UCDavisLibrary/v3-deployment) for instructions on deploying via Docker.
